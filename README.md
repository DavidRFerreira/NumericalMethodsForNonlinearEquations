# NumericalMethodsForNonlinearEquations

## Description

An equation is said to be nonlinear when it involves terms of degree higher than 1 in the unknown quantity. 
Nonlinear equations cannot in general be solved analytically. In this case, therefore, the solutions of the equations must be approached using iterative methods. The principle of the methods of solving consists in starting from an arbitrary point - the closest possible point to the solution sought - and involves arriving at the solution gradually through sucessive tests.

In other words, the algorithms available on this repository can be used to approximate solutions of equations when exact solutions can not be determined via algebraic methods.
